          <p>April is Earth month, and the annual Sustainability Solutions Showcase was hosted on campus. I was able to talk to some of the people who put together projects for this event, and we discussed ways to find hope in the climate crisis.</p>

          <p>This year, the University of Colorado Boulder Student Government wanted to bring positive change to campus, in the form of bringing awareness to the epidemic of sexual assault. I was able to find out why this cause is so important.</p>

          <p>Boulder is home to several acapella groups, the newest of which is One Note Stand. I took a deep dive into what it is like to be a member of this group, and how its members are passionate about it.</p>

          <h3>Youth Sports - Kids are Kickin' It</h3>
          <h4>by Zoe Paulson</h4>
          <h4>October 30, 2021</h4>
          <p>Youth sports are so important to our society. Kids learn basic motor skills, communication skills, and most importantly, they learn how to be teammates. I talked with some kids (and their parents, the coaches) about this dynamic in their lives.</p>

          <h3>Women's Basketball in the Big Dance</h3>
          <h4>by Zoe Paulson</h4>
          <h4>April 17, 2021</h4>
          <p>The March Madness tournament is the most exciting part of college basketball, but in 2021, the women's version of this tournament was taken much less seriously, by the NCAA itself. I talked with some members of our CU Buffs' women's team about their thoughts and frustrations.
