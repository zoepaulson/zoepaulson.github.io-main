      <h1>One Note Stand: Singing their Way to Perfection</h1>

      <p>Every Thursday and Sunday night this past fall, 13 CU Boulder students gathered to practice their singing craft together. They broke into small groups to practice their parts. In one room, men sang deep sounding “dum-dum-de-dums.” In another, the women sang melodic “ah-ah-ahs.” Scattered into separate elements, the song hardly sounds like a song. Alone, the different lines sound nice, but to the untrained ear, it does not sound like anything that you might have heard before.
</p>
      <p>But when members of One Note Stand, one of about nine acapella groups on campus, gather back together and sing as one, something dramatic happens.
</p>
      <p>“Being a part of a group and putting something together that sounds amazing is one of the most gratifying things,” music director Nathan Zurfluh said. “I think I’ve always liked every aspect of it, whether it’s the community, doing stuff on your own and finding cool sounds that work, or seeing everything come together.
</p>
      <p>“It really tickles my brain,” the senior, who studies integrative physiology, said.</p>
      <p>To the average listener, music is music. It can sound fun, it can sound bad. It can even sound beautiful. But for anyone who is a singer themselves, music is more than just “fun”. It is a passion, and they carry it with them everywhere. Many CU Boulder students feel this way about singing and music, and some of them choose to make it a part of their college experience by joining an acapella group.
</p>
      <p>One Note Stand is CU’s youngest acapella group. Since 2016, they’ve been meeting twice a week to practice singing songs together, for concerts and competitions. Together, they’ve grown in their singing abilities, their passion for music, and their bonds with each other.
</p>
      <p>In acapella music, there are no instruments, only voices. These voices give each piece a more exciting and dramatic feel, if it’s done well. Lily Schilling is a voice performance and psychology double major, and she joined One Note Stand earlier this year. She has been performing with her voice for many years, but this is her first time with an acapella group.
</p>
      <p>After performing so many serious classical music pieces, she said, “I was looking for a place to have more fun with music outside of classical performance.”</p>
      <p>But the excitement added to acapella music does not come easily. So much work goes into preparing each song for performance.
</p>
      <p>All of this singing and practicing and, eventually, choreography fall under the control of the group’s president, Karuna Shipper, who is senior studying international affairs and Arabic. She fell in love with singing at a young age, and decided that it should be part of her college experience.
</p>
      <p>She never thought that singing would become as influential in her life as it is currently. As she is in charge of so much within the club, she is always working on ways to make her group become better and better.
</p>
      <p>“This role has made me really appreciate all the backstage work,” Shipper said. “It’s made my work ethic improve, and my leadership style as well.”
</p>
      <p>Singing has always been a strong influence in her life, even since she was young. Her passion derives from her desire to learn more about music, and to use that knowledge to make better music.
</p>
      <p>Through One Note Stand, she’s seen the ways that music can be complex and intricate.</p>
      <p>“The more I’ve learned about how complicated it can be, and how smart or intelligent you have to be to make a really good composition, it’s really elevated my appreciation for good music,” she said. “And it’s made me want to do it.”
</p>
      <p>There are so many reasons that people are passionate about music and singing, and each one is deeply personal. Schilling has also been singing since she was little. Her commitment to singing is what drew her to study it in college. For her, singing is a deeply personal and exhilarating experience. It’s an outlet to relieve stress and to feel good about life in general.
</p>
      <p>“It’s been my outlet since I was 5. It’s always been the one counsel in my life,” she said. “It’s so personally attached to you. Your instrument is your body. You can’t put it down, it’s attached to how you’re feeling that day, your mood, how your body feels. Every single day it’s different. That’s why it’s so rewarding; it’s because it’s so personally attached to you.”
</p>
      <p>Acapella is a perfect way to use this passion. For all 13 members of One Note Stand, rehearsals are more than just a club meeting. It’s a place where they can release their passions in the form of songs, within a community of friends who feel the same happiness when they sing together.
</p>
      <p>One Note Stand performs at least three times a year, often more than that. There are concerts each semester, competitions within CU Boulder, and even auditions for international competitions.
</p>
      <p>According to Shipper, the biggest annual performance that they do is called Acapalooza.</p>
      <p>“Basically, all of the traditional acapella groups on campus will perform two or three songs in a concert,” she said. “It’s a lot of fun, we get to hang out with the groups afterwards. We get to see what other groups are doing and how much work they’ve done, and also get to show how much hard work we’ve done.”
</p>
      <p>Through Acapalooza, and through supporting each other, all of the CU acapella groups form one big community on campus. There are about eight or nine groups total, although many of them represent different communities. For example, there are a few men’s acapella groups and a few women’s acapella groups. One Note Stand is one of three co-ed acapella groups. And each one has their own sound and their own voice.
</p>
      <p>“We’re a completely co-ed group that specializes in pop and songs that aren’t typically known as acapella songs,” Zurfluh said of One Note Stand’s unique voice and tone. “We're not one of the more traditional acapella groups. I honestly think we just have more fun.”</p>
      <p>Outside of Boulder, the biggest competition for any college acapella group is the International Collegiate Championship of Acapella, or ICCA. The hit movie “Pitch Perfect,” released in 2012 and generating over $115 million at the box office, showcases this real-life event.
</p>
      <p>The best college acapella groups from all over the United States, as well as Canada and the United Kingdom, perform in the ICCAs.
</p>
      <p>Back in 2019, One Note Stand got the opportunity to perform at the Southwest Region’s quarterfinal competition in Utah. Zurfluh and Shipper both recall this as the best acapella performance of their careers.</p>
      <p>“And that was super cool because we had choreography, we had a really good stage, really good auditorium, a really good sound set up which is so so important,” Zurfluh said. “And we put on just a killer performance.”</p>
      <p>Shipper also remembers the excitement of the event, and the intense amount of work that went into it.
</p>
      <p>“It was a culmination of so much hard work. Just hours and hours of stress,” she said. “And we did really really well.”
</p>
      <p>On November 15, One Note Stand received news that they would be competing in the 2022 ICCA tournament. They are one of 37 teams across seven states in the Southwest region. Out of all of the groups at CU Boulder, One Note Stand is one of two to be chosen.
</p>
      <p>Zurfluh got to break the news to the rest of the group just before everyone went on fall break.
</p>
      <p>“Oh, it was awesome. It always feels good, especially since it is a small group,” he said. “So that feels good, especially since we’re representing the school in an actual competition, which is just fantastic.”
</p>
      <p>They will perform for the live audience in Aurora, Colorado, on February 5. In the meantime, there is a lot of work to be done to prepare for the event.
</p>
      <p>In the weeks leading up to a big competition or concert, the group will rehearse three or four times a week, for up to three hours. But no one in the group is deterred by a little hard work.
</p>
      <p>While they have been creating an elite group of acapella singers, they have also been creating a bond within themselves that is incredibly strong.
</p>
      <p>“One Note Stand is popularly known for having a familial sense to the group,” Shipper said. “We really do a lot of things outside of rehearsal to strengthen our bonds and our sense of family within the group.”</p>
      <p>They are more than a group who sings. They are a group who studies together, meets for girls’ nights, and lives life together.
</p>
      <p>“My college experience would absolutely not be the same without it. I’ve met incredible people and I’ve grown as a person,” Shipper said. “[The group members] really helped me navigate college outside of acapella. I see them for two hours twice a week, which really isn’t a lot. But the people in the group really care about how I’m doing, as a person and within music.”
</p>
      <p>They are carrying this bond with them to the ICCAs this spring. The morale is up and they are excited for all of it.
</p>
      <p>“It does feel like a mini family,” Shipper said. “I honestly do think it makes us sound better.”
