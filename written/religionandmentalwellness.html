      <h1>In Our Darkest Places: How Religiosity and Spirituality Can Be Life-Changing and Life-Saving</h1>
      <h3>by Zoe Paulson</h3>
      <p>The organ thunders powerfully across the church in the familiar tune. The “Alleluia” pours across the crowded hall, signaling everyone to stand for the next part of the Mass. Wolfgang Knapek stands confidently and listens to the sounds of singing, although most of the congregation is way out of tune.
</p>
      <p>The fading light outside serves to brighten the stained-glass windows. Statues adorn both sides of the altar with a large crucifix front and center. The churchgoers look humbly up to it. Students in Boulder, Colorado, go to this sanctuary to leave the stresses of student life behind, if even for just an hour or so.
</p>
      <p>A few minutes later, the priest signals for the churchgoers to line up for communion. They walk up in a line, prepared to receive the Eucharist. Wolfgang shuffles out of the pew and into the aisle, then walks up prayerfully. Nothing out of the ordinary to your average bystander. But that average bystander would not know about what it took for Wolfgang to be walking up there.
</p>
      <p>Only a year ago, Wolfgang would have been unable to stand for the Alleluia. He could not have walked up the aisle. He would not have been able to even come to church of his own accord. In fact, he would not have been able to walk from his bed to his couch without his parents’ help. Any sort of movement would have triggered intense pain. For a year and a half, he was practically frozen, and in desperate need of a saving grace.
</p>
      <p>Wolfgang grew up Catholic, but only practiced to the extent that his parents forced him. He went to Catholic school and found friends that were in the same boat. They grew up Catholic, but didn’t connect with faith beyond that. All those friends went from the same Catholic grade school, to the same Catholic high school, then on to the University of Colorado Boulder.
</p>
      <p>“I kind of grew further away from the church once I went to college. It was never really like a strong attachment to the faith overall,” he said.
</p>
      <p>In Boulder, he had a normal college experience. He was majoring in Integrative Physiology. He went to the gym. He went to parties with his friends on the weekends. In general, he had a typical, good college life.
</p>
      <p>In theory, everything was going perfectly according to plan. But Wolfgang could not shake the feeling that he was not happy, despite having everything he thought he needed.
</p>
      <p>“I had a lot of good stuff going for me coming out of high school. From a world-cultural perspective, everything was really great.” Viewing happiness on a 10-point scale, however, Wolfgang rates this time period of his life as a measly four out of 10. “There would still be regular occurrences where I was just down in the dumps, just depressed and stuff like that. Like a couple times a month at least. Some sadness was always just a part of life and I was just like that's how it is.”
</p>
      <p>Then, everything was stripped away from him. He had been working out, practically every day. He neglected taking proper rest times in between intense workouts. Not entirely unusual, but it caused him a lot of arm pain. Eventually, his arms started to feel pain all the time, even when he was doing simple tasks. After a while, the tissue healed, like most workout injuries. But the nerves in his arms were more stubborn.
</p>
      <p>Gradually, the pain spread to the rest of his body. It became chronic.
</p>
      <p>“It was this weird, persistent pain and then that spread through my body over the course of like a year and a half,” he remembered. “The last six months I was just stuck in bed. I couldn't really do much of anything.”
</p>
      <p>Wolfgang doesn’t know whether to call it an illness or an injury. Doctors were confused by his condition for most of the year and half that he was, quite literally, bedridden. He had to take a break from school and his friends. His new life was just moving from his bed to his parents’ couch.
</p>
      <p>This was rock bottom.
</p>
      <p>He couldn’t walk, he couldn’t move his arms, he couldn’t speak to people.
</p>
      <p>Life became nothing but the pain.
</p>
      <p>“I kind of wanted to know, is there really a point in continuing like this? Nothing's fun anymore. So, what's the point in living?”
</p>
      <p>Religion is not what someone might expect Wolfgang to turn to. Historically, college students are significantly less likely to be religious than older people. Even more, Gen Z is the least religious generation that the world has seen.
</p>
      <p>In 1986, only 10% of college students claimed to have no religious affiliation, and in 2016 that number rose to 31%. In the same amount of time, the amount of college students attending any sort of religious service dipped from 85% to 69%, according to the American Freshman Survey, which surveys college newcomers across the country.
</p>
      <p>It’s safe to say that religiosity and college life don’t seem to go together. It is counterintuitive for Wolfgang to even consider this. And yet, with everything else stripped away, Wolfgang turned to the Bible.
</p>
      <p>“It was partially out of a curiosity to see if there was anything beyond this world, because I was sick of this world,” he remembered thinking. Originally, he was reading almost as an attempt to disprove religion. He couldn’t do anything else, so why not do a deep dive into some of life’s deepest questions? He didn’t expect a God to hear him, but he had run out of other ways to keep his mind off the pain.
</p>
      <p>Eventually, to his surprise, Wolfgang saw the world around him change. His prayers seemed like they were… being answered? He was skeptical, and slowly that skepticism fell away. There was no sudden moment where religion was revealed to him. He gradually noticed that the world around him might have more meaning than he thought.
</p>
      <p>“I started noticing that my prayers were producing effects, beyond just what I would call a coincidental amount,” he said. “If you observe it for a long enough time, that's just statistically impossible.”
</p>
      <p>He started to think that maybe this faith, which he had brushed off for so long, might be worth delving into.
</p>
      <p>“If this isn't just coincidence, I should really take this seriously. If it isn't a coincidence, then there's nothing more serious than this.”
</p>
      <p>So Wolfgang spent his days on the couch, looking into religion. He did research into every major world religion, before settling on the one his parents raised him around. He started reading the Bible, listening to Catholic podcasts, and watching a number of Catholic priests with YouTube channels.
</p>
      <p>“The bulk of my learning experience with religion was kind of just me on the Internet,” he said. “Now and then, I would have a question about the faith, and I would just Google it and some smart Catholic guy would tell me how it makes sense.”
</p>
      <p>And, of course, he prayed. He prayed about his own health, about his mental state, and about his life. He prayed for the people close to him. And he prayed that he would get to grow deeper in this faith that he discovered.
</p>
      <p>“It felt like I just got a letter to Hogwarts or something. I had no idea that this whole other world was out there.”
</p>
      <p>He learned everything he possibly could about the Catholic faith, and he grew closer and closer to it. He started using the Bible as a sort of moral compass. He cut things out of his life that Catholics teach to be sinful. Then, Wolfgang realized a pattern. Most of those things were actually the root of his own unhappiness, even in indirect ways.
</p>
      <p>“Pretty much most religions that believe in an afterlife, that’s eternity after this,” he said. “The time spent on Earth really is so so tiny in comparison to that. That kind of blows away every weird kind of anxiety… of course that's some real stuff, but it just sinks under the radar.”
</p>
      <p>With these anxieties virtually gone from his life, Wolfgang started to feel freer.
</p>
      <p>“During that injury or illness or whatever it was, that was as low as I could go. I was really really bad,” he said of his mental health during that time.
</p>
      <p>He suffered for a year and a half. Nonstop pain ruled his life for the full 18 months. But once he found himself praying and living in faith, although his physical pain was as strong as ever, his mental pain faded. In the last couple months of his suffering, he says, he was happier than he ever was.
</p>
      <p>“It was just shocking, quite frankly. Like I said, I couldn't do anything. I was literally just on the couch all day and my parents would help me out with getting food and stuff. And I was way happier than in high school. You figure out that things have meaning, when the world presents them as not having any meaning.”
</p>
      <p>Father Matt Magee is one of the Catholic priests at St. Thomas Aquinas in Boulder. He connects to the people within his community when they are struggling with themselves, and he helps them to find healing.
</p>
      <p>“As human beings, we are body and soul. We have thoughts, feelings, and actions. Men and women are religious beings by nature, in the sense that we long for relationships with other people, with Creation, and with a higher power,” Magee said. “The relationship between the head and the heart, we can say, is like the relationship between mental wellbeing and religious well-being. They are super connected.”
</p>
      <p>As a priest, Magee sees this relationship in an interesting light. On the one hand, he can see the dramatic sufferings and challenges of the people in his community. And on the other hand, he sees that this pain can turn into good.
</p>
      <p>“If we are attentive and attuned to our religious well-being, spiritual well-being, and mental well-being, that there’s a real growth that can take place,” he said.
</p>
      <p>Scholars and researchers have produced many studies which show a correlation between mental wellness and having a religious and spiritual life.
</p>
      <p>According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), organized religion provides teachings and ways of life for a person to follow. Through religion, people learn the importance of compassion and love. Faith-oriented people are more likely to learn to forgive people who have wronged them in the past. Living a virtuous life, guided by precepts of an organized religion, can help people learn to love themselves.
</p>
      <p>For Wolfgang, he learned the ways that he can better himself through Catholic teaching. He became a better version of himself, and therefore a happier version of himself.
</p>
      <p>During his struggles, Wolfgang and his parents had been searching for a doctor who could diagnose his condition. Finally, on Nov. 1, 2021, they found some answers.
</p>
      <p>Dr. Bradley Fanestil, from Boulder Community Health, defined Wolfgang’s burden as Neuroplastic Pain Syndrome.
</p>
      <p>Wolfgang learned that, although the tissue had healed from his injury, the nerves were still sending pain signals to his brain. His nerves could not recognize what should be painful and what shouldn’t. Nerves should send pain signals to the brain if, for example, you are kicked in the stomach, or stub your toe, or get punched in the face. Wolfgang’s brain sent those same signals even if he was just walking or talking.
</p>
      <p>With this knowledge, Wolfgang entered into psychological therapy, where he trained his nerves to relearn what should and shouldn't be painful.
</p>
      <p>“You have to retrain your brain to realize, hey, walking is not hurting us,” he said.
</p>
      <p>After about a month of treatment, Wolfgang was miraculously and completely free of pain.
</p>
      <p>He went back to school, with his old friends and his old life. But there was a crucial change in that. His friends did not have the same experience he did, and Wolfgang’s priorities had completely changed.
</p>
      <p>“God kind of just became the centerpiece of everything I was doing or thinking about. And when none of your friends care at all about that, that's really kind of polarizing,” he said.
</p>
      <p>When Wolfgang’s life was changed so dramatically, it was all that he wanted to talk about. He felt that it was so important, that he should be talking and thinking about it constantly. Abel Campos, who shares a room with Wolfgang in college and has been his best friend since the pair was in preschool, listened to all of his religious rants.
</p>
      <p>And although he did not consider himself to be religious, Abel never wavered in being Wolfgang’s friend. Even as Wolfgang was stuck at his parents’ house, Abel would visit him and they would be able to talk. Wolfgang would excitedly share his newest revelations about his spiritual life, and Abel would listen happily.
</p>
      <p>Abel watched his friend transform from someone that liked to party and indulge in the world around him, to someone who cared about everything with conviction.
</p>
      <p>“I would listen, and I believed him. But I was like, eh, I don’t really care,” he said. “I was really tied up in myself… I had a lot of pride issues. I lived a life purely for myself.”
</p>
      <p>But still, Wolfgang was persistent. And eventually, Abel started to realize that what he was saying might actually have some merit. He felt that when he prayed, he was doing more than “just speaking words.”
</p>
      <p>And just like that, Abel was hooked on the idea of something more than himself. He began walking with Wolfgang on their now-shared journey.
</p>
      <p>The pair found the St. Thomas Aquinas church in Boulder, where they found that belonging that they craved. Now, they join the community for Sunday Mass, and even go to daily Masses. Together, they go on semesterly retreats with the group. But most importantly, the group serves as a powerful witness to what faith and spirituality can be.
</p>
      <p>“The welcomeness and openness of everybody here and the clear joy and love they felt in their lives on account of Christ, I was like, something’s happening… the love of God just does that in your life,” Abel said.
</p>
      <p>Now, just as they were in grade school and in high school, Wolfgang and Abel’s friendship is of the strongest type. They go to Mass together, and within the Catholic community, they are seen as an inseparable duo. When you see one of them, it would be a good guess to assume that the other is close behind. They hang out together, laughing, commenting on each other’s mustaches, and having deep conversations that they couldn’t have with the rest of their friend group.
</p>
      <p>Both of them say that, without the other, there is a likely chance that they would have fallen away from the faith, without that strong supportive friend.
</p>
      <p>According to NAMI, community is another of the main benefits of religiosity. Having a sense of belonging to a group is hugely important to a person’s wellbeing. Without feeling like they have people in their lives that they can trust and love, a person’s life can become isolated and lonely. This isolation promotes mental illness.
</p>
      <p>While Wolfgang laid on his bed all that time, he found God. And when he returned to college, he found the community that fueled his faith, and made his mental and overall health better and better. With his best friend, and his greater community of friends, he grows in faith and in health.
</p>
      <p>“Everything feels very peaceful now, because the worldly stuff is very minimized once you have that kind of religious anchor,” Wolfgang said.
</p>
      <p>But, of course, not everyone finds the exact same religious anchor as Wolfgang. Religion and spirituality can manifest in an infinite amount of forms.
</p>
      <p>Susan Aposhyan grew up in Richmond, Virginia, the former capital of the Confederacy, during the Jim Crow era. She grew up seeing “whites only” signs in grocery stores. In school, she learned about the “war between the states,” not the Civil War. She was taught that slaves were happy on the plantations. It was confusing for her to live out her Armenian-American heritage with all this conflict between whites and Blacks.
</p>
      <p>She was a normal, hippie suburban kid. She and her friends went to school, hung out at pizza places, went to concerts, and the like. But underneath, there was more than that.
</p>
      <p>“I was in pain, but I kind of just ignored it,” she said. “My friends were doing the same thing. We didn’t talk about our challenges, we just tried to have fun.”
</p>
      <p>She grew up going to church. But in a city full of so much hate and discrimination, it was hard to imagine that anyone, even those who went to church, cared about others. She felt that no one truly believed in what they were claiming to believe in, not even the minister.
</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t connect to the God that I learned about in church,” Susan expressed. “But in hindsight, looking back I felt a lot of spiritual energy. I loved being in church, looking at the windows and the ceiling so tall, singing the songs.”
</p>
      <p>She looks back on it with a sort of fondness, although she knew that this was not her path. Instead, when she was sixteen she began meditating.
</p>
      <p>20 minutes in the morning, and 20 at night.
</p>
      <p>“It became a real anchor for me.”
</p>
      <p>This anchor was so important for her, as her family life became more and more tumultuous. She was never diagnosed with a mental disorder herself, but it was all around her. The situation came to a peak when her mother committed suicide when Susan was 17.
</p>
      <p>“There was depression, there was suicide, there was workaholism, there was adultery,” she said. “As a kid I looked at the adults and I thought, that looks horrible. Why are you people doing this?”
</p>
      <p>With the world around her in such a disturbed state, she continued to look inward. She discovered Buddhism, and connected with it immediately and completely. The 20 minutes of mediation became more and more as the years went on, and Susan became an expert at seeing into herself.
</p>
      <p>“A lot of Buddhism is just reminders about opening your heart and being kind to others and helping others,” she said. Her voice is soft and calming, like she is a walking meditation herself. “It’s about reflecting on yourself and trying to be a better person.”
</p>
      <p>In her early 20s, as she delved more deeply into Buddhism, she also became a psychotherapist. In the 1970s, these were considered two separate entities, and Susan did not mix the two important areas of her life.
</p>
      <p>Despite this, as Susan grew in her spirituality, it became harder to ignore the ways that it was connected to her mental health. She began to see the flaws in leaving psychology as a stand-alone practice, and began to wonder how spirituality might help her clients in their journey towards mental wellness.
</p>
      <p>“Sometimes, in psychology, you get to a certain point and you just get stuck in the psychological world, and just keep spinning around,” she said. “It’s like, this happened to me, and I’m neurotic for this reason, and in this way.”
</p>
      <p>There is no point in talking about neurosis if there is no way to gain freedom from it. And so Susan tried to find ways to bring that freedom into her psychotherapy sessions.
</p>
      <p>“You need to look at your spiritual life here and pause,” she said. “Slow down and feel things more deeply, and not just think about what happened to you and how it affected you.”
</p>
      <p>Staying stuck in this looping mindset is dangerous for patients of psychotherapy, and can even be fatal for those suffering from depression.
</p>
      <p>In 2004, Susan published a book called “Body-Mind Psychotherapy.” In it, she outlines practices, techniques, and ways of thinking of spirituality as a means to achieve mental wellness. She was nervous about coming out to the psychology community and showing how important she believed this concept to be, but she knew that she needed to do it.
</p>
      <p>“I think spirituality holds a central place in the mental health world,” she said. “It’s not for everybody, but I feel that as a counselor, I have to hold my client’s spiritual development, whether that’s a word they like or use, and look at how sometimes people need to deepen their path to heal what they need to heal.”
</p>
      <p>Now, she is the author of three books on the subject, and hosts her own online embodied spirituality guided meditations and sharing circles. The sessions are a peaceful space for her students, and also for her.
</p>
      <p>Without Buddhism, she said, “I don’t know that I’d be alive, I honestly don’t.”
</p>
      <p>She credits Buddhism to helping her survive growing up, raising children, being married, having cancer, and now living in peace. “Over the years, I’ve come to understand myself, understand other humans better, and understand pain. People hurt each other out of pain. We have a tiny little crack sometimes to be able to get in and interrupt those patterns and treat each other more kindly.”
</p>
      <p>And, throughout this time, she has begun to see that religion and spirituality may be the most important aspects of our mental wellness.
</p>
      <p>Sometimes, people enter into psychology and find themselves spiritually there. Other times people want to become more spiritual and they realize that they need psychological help as well. Either way, the two are undeniably connected.
</p>
      <p>Connected for Susan’s clients, and for Susan.
</p>
      <p>“I feel pretty content with my life, pretty relaxed about who I am, and accepting of who I am,” she said, smiling lovingly. “Finally! It’s taken a long time for me to say that.”
</p>
      <p>~~~~~
</p>
      <p>In 2022, a survey of 50 Boulder community members of varying religions and ages asked questions about faith and spirituality as a means of mental wellness. A staggering 90% of them answered that their general happiness was better once they solidified themselves in their journey towards their particular faith.
</p>
      <p>Participants were also asked to report whether or not they believe that mental well-being and religion are correlated, on a scale of one to five. An answer of five meant that the participant believed that their faith saved their well-being. An answer of one meant that they believe the concepts are not correlated at all.
</p>
      <p>In the survey, 44% answered with a five, meaning that their mental happiness and their religion are highly correlated. Only 4% gave it a two out of five.
</p>
      <p>No one answered one out of five.
</p>
      <p>After hitting the lowest point of his life, Wolfgang changed his lifestyle, and now, he rates himself on the happiness scale as a “10 out of 10. Like, always. And I don’t think that’s ever going to really change. There’s hard times and stuff, but it’s never isolating and it’s never anything you can’t get through. God's giving you stuff that you can handle no matter what it might be.”
</p>
      <p>And Susan, after 50 years of learning to love herself and the people around her, has found happiness and peace. By intertwining spirituality with her work along with her four grandchildren, who she says are her greatest joy, she harvests the peace in her life.
</p>
      <p>Religion and spirituality are incredibly complicated. Organized religions have complicated teachings, and produce complicated feelings. Susan struggles with the idea of organized religion, saying, “I don’t like any organization that controls other people. And at the same time, I appreciate the structure that religion gives people when it works. It’s a complex thing.”
</p>
      <p>And yet, there is no denying that these organized religious spaces are conducive to life-altering experiences of happiness and goodness, as exemplified by Wolfgang’s testimony.
</p>
      <p>People may doubt that meditations and spirituality can be helpful. The modern world is so entranced with busyness, that it seems like a waste of time to most.
</p>
      <p>And yet, there is no denying that Susan and her practices have helped her and countless people that have struggled with their mental health.
</p>
      <p>Religion, spirituality, and mental wellness are undoubtedly connected, although those pieces might connect differently from person to person.
</p>
      <p>Wolfgang and Susan are different people. They have different backgrounds, have different ethnicities, are from different generations, and practice different religions. And yet, both of them found themselves in the saving grace of religion and spirituality.
</p>
      <p>“We come into this world with this incredibly open heart and love and connection to the larger spiritual world, however we articulate that. We might call it God or spirit or the universe or nature,” she said. “And then life gets complicated and we get bumped around. And to some degree we shut down.”
</p>
      <p>Susan sees this every day in her practice, and, from experience, she has seen people regain that openness and love. But she doesn’t know anyone who was able to do that without tapping, in some way, into their spirituality.
