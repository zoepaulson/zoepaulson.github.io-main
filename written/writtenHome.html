      <p>For Jonnie Ellis, fitness is a lifestyle. Even more than that, it has always helped him find purpose and healing. “It’s always been a really powerful thing in my life to keep myself grounded. I’ve also seen the impact and change that it can make on people,” he said.</p>

        <p>But what makes this small city’s town hall so extraordinary? The answer is simple: this is Colorado’s first and only all-female city council.</p>

        <h3>Fly Fishing Documentary Reels in Denver Audience</h3>
        <h4>by Zoe Paulson</h4>
        <h4>May 21, 2022</h4>
        <p>In May, the Bug Theater in Highland hosted the “Casting Forward” event, a documentary series premiere about women in fly fishing. Ms. Mayhem, an online publication which presents a fresh perspective on feminism, put together the multimedia project. With a special focus on gear, safety, conservation and education, and the lack of visibility for women in marginalized communities, the project showed the surprising issues within the sport, and told the stories of the women who are casting forward to the future.</p>

        <h3>One Note Stand: Singing their Way to Perfection</h3>
        <h4>by Zoe Paulson</h4>
        <h4>November 21, 2021</h4>
        <p>Every Thursday and Sunday night this past fall, 13 CU Boulder students gathered to practice their singing craft together. Scattered into separate elements, the song hardly sounds like a song. Alone, the different lines sound nice, but to the untrained ear, it does not sound like anything that you might have heard before.</p>

        <p>CU Boulder pre-med senior Delaney Koontz discovered her passion for medicine through her mom, who has diabetes. After seeing what her mom’s endocrinologist was able to do for her, Koontz decided that she wanted to do that for others.</p>
