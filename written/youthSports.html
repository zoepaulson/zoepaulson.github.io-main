      <p>Every Saturday morning this past fall, the Westminster Youth Soccer League met for gameday, and October 30th was no exception. The morning air was a little chilly, and the parents could be seen carrying mugs of coffee. Fields lined the recreational center in Westminster, Colorado. The crowds gathered, all to see some kids play a game that they loved.</p>
      <p>Among them were Wyatt and Calder, five year olds who played on a U6 boys team. In the field across from .them was the U5 girls league, where girls like Peyton and Kinley shined. These four kids are among the millions across the United States who play youth soccer, and they do so with excitement and smiles on their faces.</p>
      <p>Many kids, like these four, start playing sports at quite a young age, often four or five years old. Parents believe that sports can have multiple positive effects on kids. Many parents put their kids in sports like soccer to help them become more social and to make friends.</p>
      <p>“We think it’s important to make sure that he’s involved in stuff outside of school,” Victoria, Wyatt’s mom, said.</p>
      <p>Similarly, parents hope that their kids can learn team skills. Scott, who is Peyton’s dad, said, “It’s good for teamwork. I think that all kids should do something competitive.”</p>
      <p>For other parents, exercise is the most important part of sending their kids to soccer practice. Keith is Calder’s father, and he said, “It’s extremely healthy and it’s a lot of running. Get him going with hand eye coordination.”</p>
      <p>And for parents who want their child to be active, they also hope to tire out the high-spirited behavior of kids their age. “She needs to get her energy out, and this is the perfect avenue for her to play with her friends,” said Dave, whose daughter is Kinley.</p>
      <p>Kids love to play soccer, and many parents think that it is the perfect outlet for them. But sports are more than just a great way to spend a Saturday morning. According to CU Boulder sports psychologist Dr. Chelsea Pierotti, youth team sports can be incredibly beneficial to kids for multiple reasons.</p>
      <p>First, it helps kids to build important relationships with their fellow athletes. “Certainly there is a teamwork aspect, and being able to understand how to assist your teammate even if you didn’t have a great game,” she said. “Celebrating other athletes’ wins doesn’t hurt your own.”</p>
      <p>There are also leadership qualities that kids learn through sport. They set long term goals for themselves, whether that goal is to play well in the game next week, or to play sports in college years down the line. Kids can learn that it is okay to experience setbacks, and that they can become better because of that. </p>
      <p>Physical activity is a dominant attribute of sport, which is beneficial in and of itself, as exercise is important for kids’ development. But new research shows that exercise has a link to academics. Kids who are active throughout the day tend to do better in school than those who are not, according to Dr. Pierotti.</p>
      <p>And lastly, younger kids benefit from sports because it can help with basic functions of the brain. “There’s also some evidence that kids are better at some executive function skills,” Dr. Pierotti said. “So being able to plan and organize thought and impulse control. Some of those skills can come through sport as well.”</p>
      <p>Kids like Wyatt, Calder, Kinley, and Peyton are learning these skills now, as four and five year olds, by playing soccer. They may have an advantage over other kids their age, who aren’t in sports.</p>
      <p>Often, especially at such a young age, the coaches of the teams are volunteers, typically parents to a child on the team. The U5 and U6 soccer teams in Westminster are no exception to this trend. Can this also be a benefit to the kids of these coaches?</p>
      <p>There is varying evidence on the psychological role of parents as coaches. Dr. Pieriotti says that parents can certainly strengthen their relationship with their child by becoming their coach.</p>
      <p>“The child is seeing the parent, and, if they are doing things well, there could be a really positive model,” Dr. Pierotti said.</p>
      <p>The coach’s kids may be more inclined to copy their behavior. If they are showing good habits, like physical activity, the child may be more likely to be active into adulthood. Or if a parent instills a growth mindset into their team, the same modeling effect could occur. Parents could effectively teach their children to treat everyone equally, show respect to other parents and other players, and how to have good sportsmanship.</p>
      <p>Peyton’s dad, Scott, is the coach for the U5 girls’ team. He hoped to grow his relationship with his daughter and show her all these good qualities. They spend time practicing together, whether it’s with the team or just in their backyard.</p>
      <p>“I thought I could maybe be a role model to her,” he said.</p>
      <p>Dr. Pierotti also notes that there are “a lot of parallels between parenting styles and coaching styles.”</p>
      <p>For example, if a parent is more democratic at home, in letting the kids make their own decisions and allowing for communication, they will reflect that in their coaching style.</p>
      <p>Keith is the coach of the U6 boys. He doesn’t coach in order to build his relationship with his son, Calder; he does it because he already has that relationship with his son.</p>
      <p>“I’m a stay at home dad, so I have a strong relationship with the kids already,” he said. “The relationship hasn’t really changed, but I can definitely see the dynamic that it can be tough to be the coach’s kid… your own boy is the one that you can use as a discipline target.”</p>
      <p>Dr. Pierotti warned that this positive modeling effect can be very powerful in the reverse. If a parent is in a coaching position and treats team members poorly, complains about referees, or gets angry when they lose, the child can easily adopt that behavior as well.</p>
      <p>Parents with a more authoritarian approach to parenting will typically have the same approach to coaching. They may be very demanding, and might refuse to listen to feedback from players or their child.</p>
      <p>In this instance, the relationship between parent and child can become weaker, as a child will become easily frustrated with their parents, and therefore frustrated with sports. They may also reflect poor behavior that their parent exhibits.</p>
      <p>But coaches like Scott and Keith are among the good ones. They promote hard work and strength on their teams, but focus mostly on having fun and exercising.</p>
      <p>That October 30th game was the last of the season for both the U5 girls and the U6 boys. Each of the kids left with a trophy, a beaming smile, and an excitement for next season.</p>
      <p>Victoria’s son Wyatt is on Keith’s team, and she said, “It’s 5 and 6 year olds, so it’s managing chaos sometimes, but he does a great job at it.”</p>
