      <h1>Doctoring in a New Age</h1>
      <h3>by Zoe Paulson</h3>
      <p>CU Boulder pre-med senior Delaney Koontz discovered her passion for medicine through her mom, who has diabetes. After seeing what her mom’s endocrinologist was able to do for her, Koontz decided that she wanted to do that for others.
</p>
      <p>“Her whole life she thought she wasn’t able to have kids, because she was told that people with diabetes couldn’t have kids,” she said. “Because of her endocrinologist, she was able to have kids. That’s why I’m here.”
</p>
      <p>Becoming a doctor is no easy task. It can take up to fifteen years of schooling, thousands of hours of volunteer work, and, even then, women who earn the title “doctor” work long, hard hours in a male dominated field. Nonetheless, an increasing number of women are entering the profession.
</p>
      <p>First, one spends four years in undergraduate school. They can study whatever they want, but typically they study something that fits all the requirements to get into medical school, like organic chemistry and biology.
</p>
      <p>There are a lot of resources available for women who are interested in becoming doctors, one of which is the American Medical Women’s Association, or AMWA.</p>
      <p>AMWA is a national organization dedicated to helping women in a traditionally male- dominated field. At CU Boulder, there is a chapter of AMWA which helps female students find a support group.
</p>
      <p>Koontz is one of the co-presidents of the club. She accredits much of her college success to the club. </p>
      <p>“Everything I know about medical school and my journey is because of AMWA. It has been such an incredible resource just to make me more prepared for the next ten years of my life,” she said. “I also have a lot of friends in AMWA which is really nice.”
</p>
      <p>AMWA hosts many guest speakers every semester. For Anisha Malkan, the other AMWA Boulder co-president, these speakers helped her discover what field of medicine she was most passionate about.</p>
      <p>Originally, Malkan planned on going to medical school after college, but she started to think that maybe that wasn’t the path for her. She researched and listened to some of the speakers at AMWA, and then decided to shift her focus to becoming a physician’s assistant, or a PA. </p>
      <p>“It’s about getting exposure to many kinds of places because you never know what you may end up liking,” she said.
</p>
      <p>To get into medical school, students apply fifteen months before they plan on attending, since waitlists for these schools are incredibly long. Once a student applies and gets into a medical school, they spend up to four years of medical school, although this can vary depending on what area of the field one plans to enter. PAs go to school for two or three years, but surgeons or pediatricians go to school for four years. </p>
      <p>Isabella Shelby graduated from CU Boulder in 2020, and is now in medical school at the University of Texas Southwestern.</p>
      <p>“Medical school is very different from undergrad. The volume of information is much higher and faster,” she said. “I complete about a full semester class of undergrad work every 2 weeks in medical school.”
</p>
      <p>After graduation, they are officially a doctor, but the journey does not end yet. Depending on their specialty, the doctor spends two or three years in residency. They work and learn under more experienced doctors and become experts in their field.
</p>
      <p>Some doctors fine-tune their craft even further by doing a couple years of fellowship. The process makes them even more specialized.</p>
      <p>After up to fifteen years, they are finally an official doctor!
</p>
      <p>Dr. Nancy Miller made it through every hoop in the process, and she is currently a pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Colorado Children’s Hospital. She says that going through the tough process of medical school was worth it in the end.
</p>
      <p>“I think you will be most happy if that is truly what you want to do,” she said. The medical field is very demanding. Doctors spend long hours working in a hospital and are exhausted by the time they go home. They adjust their sleep schedules and change their family dynamic. It’s not an easy task for those who hope to work in medicine. “You want to look back and be happy with your choices, so that’s why my first thing is to make sure you want it.”
</p>
      <p>Dr. Miller is certainly happy with her choices. She sees doctoring as the perfect combination of her two passions: human anatomy and helping children. “I’m very passionate about my work,” she said. “To be able to combine a research career with clinical work for me is just the pinnacle of my wishes or desires.”
</p>
      <p>Most pre-med students, medical students, and doctors share this insatiable desire to help others.
</p>
      <p>“I’ve always had a passion for helping people and I’ve always been a caring and empathetic person,” Malkan said. She sees medicine as the perfect outlet to help others physically heal.
</p>
      <p>Organizations like AMWA certainly help women like these to get into the field, and give them the tools they need to succeed. But how difficult is it to make it in medicine as a woman?
</p>
      <p>Most don’t experience sexism in school, aside from male lab partners who think that they know more than they actually do.
</p>
      <p>“In a lot of my labs, male lab partners assume that I’ll do all the work and they’ll just copy off of me and take credit for work that I did,” Koontz said.
</p>
      <p>But according to Shelby, this is the end of female discrimination in pre-med and medical school. “Largely it’s the same being a woman or man in medicine these days. Things are relatively equal.”
</p>
      <p>Dr. Miller, who was in school during the 1970s and 1980s, said that about one third of her classmates were women. Even in being a minority, she said that she never noticed a slant in teaching or in the other students.</p>
      <p>But difficulties arose once she became a surgeon, because there were simply not many female surgeons to show her the ropes and to mentor her.
</p>
      <p>“Being a woman in this field, in medical school it didn’t really enunciate itself as a difference. Being interested in orthopedic surgery was a significant difference,” she said.</p>
      <p>Currently, the ratio of male to female doctors is almost four to one nationally, according to Becker’s Hospital Review. That is certainly a significant statistic. In Colorado, the number is a bit closer to even, being about three to one.
</p>
      <p>But society may be seeing a shift in the near future. As of December 2019, according to the Washington Post, females actually outnumber males in medical schools. In the United States, women make up 50.5% of medical students.
</p>
      <p>The narrative of medicine as a male dominated field is about to change, and the women of AMWA are here to be catalysts for that change. And they are excited to do so as well. As Shelby said, “I’m biased, but I think being a doctor is the most rewarding job in the world!”
